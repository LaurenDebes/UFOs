# UFO Sightings with Javascript
Using SQL
## Overview of UFOs Analysis
We are helping Dana, a data journalist, create an HTML page to display data about UFO sightings. She wants filters by date, city, state, country, and shape that change with user input.

## UFO Results
**Filter Criteria:**
On the HTML webpage, a user can scroll down and find five filters on the left side of the page. You can filter by any number of filters at a time. Make note of the formatting, which should appear in gray before you click on the input box. The filters only use lowercase. See the image below for an example on correct formatting for each filter.

**Using Filters:** 
First, click on the field you wish to filter by, then write in your criteria. Hit "tab" or click outside of the input box in order to apply the filter to the table. An example of the filtered table is shown below.

## Summary of UFO Sightings Webpage
**Drawback of new design**
One major drawback of the new design is that it only takes lowercase user input. Users must be careful to use the correct formatting for the table to filter correctly.

**Recommendations for Further Development**
  - Add a drop-down menu to some filters such as state (as some may not be aware of all the abbreviations, and this would eliminate some user error) and shape (users may not be aware of all the shapes available to filter by)
  - The ability to filter by multiple criteria inside each field, such as more than one state or more than one shape.
  - Making the fields flexible to any sort of capitalization.
